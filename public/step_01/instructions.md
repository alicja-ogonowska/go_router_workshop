# Step 1

Welcome to the GoRouter workshop! Today, we're going to delve into some practical
examples and use cases that are common in both mobile and web apps.

This workshop was prepared with go_router version 13.1.0 in mind.

We'll start by examining the fundamentals of navigation using Navigator 1.0.

Our first task is to add navigation from MainScreen to DetailsScreen.
Additionally, we'll implement an option that allows users to navigate back
to the previous screen.
